        <h2>Steps</h2>
        </div>

        
          <h3>Gyusuji</h3>
          <ol>
          <li>Bring a pot of water to the boil and place the beef sinew inside. Boil for a few minutes to remove the excess fat from the surface.</li>
          <li>
              After a few minutes have passed, drain the water and wash the beef sinew under clean running water. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill the pot again with approximately 1 litre of water (or enough to cover the beef by 1-2cm) and bring it to a boil.
          
        </li>
        <li> While waiting for the water to heat up, cut the beef into long chunks.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, turn the heat down to simmer and add spring onion, ginger and the beef sinew. </li>
        <li>Simmer for 1 hour without a lid. (Add more water if beef sinew gets exposed to the air.)
        </li>
        <li>After one hour, remove the beef sinew and set it aside to cool. Discard the spring onion and ginger but save the broth. </li>
        <li>Continue to heat the broth until reduced by ⅓.</li>
        <li>When the beef is cool to the touch, push the pieces onto skewers. (500g should make approximately 5 skewers)</li>
          </div>
        </ol>
          <h3>Preparing Daikon</h3>
          <ol>
        <li>Peel the daikon skin and cut into thick rounds. Score one side with a cross, about 1cm deep. </li>
        <li>Boil in water until it's easy to pierce (About 15 minutes)</li>
          </ol></div>
        <h3>Oden</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Take a large pot and add 1 litre (approx 4 cups) of dashi and 100ml of the left over broth from the gyusuji beef.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp sake, ½ tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp mirin, 5 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp of oyster sauce to the broth. Bring it to a boil and let it boil for 2-3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to simmer and add the cut daikon, boiled eggs and gyusuji skewers. (You should also add any hard ingredients at this point.)</li>
        <li>Simmer for about 30 minutes and then fishcakes, tofu and any other soft ingredients you choose.</li>
        <li>Simmer for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve up and enjoy with Japanese mustard. </li>
